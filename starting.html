    <center><h2>When you first enter the game, it will give you a little pop-up that says 'Welcome to Adopt Me!'. The user will be asked to click Next. The first thing you do is dress your avatar. While you are dressing your avatar, there is a hight probability that you will get an extra 20 bucks (in-game currency) for playing the game. It will ask you to choose boys clothes or girls clothes but it really doesn't matter, lots of people mix the clothing options. Once you're finished, it tells you that you're standing in your house. You step through the front door and your daily login will pop up. Once you finish that, it will lead you to the adoption center to adopt a cat or a dog! These are both common pets, but nessecary for getting up in the Adopt Me trades. You have a conversation with Sir Woofington, and he'll give you your first starter egg. Once you finish the tasks the egg gives you, you'll hatch it and get either a dog or cat. Congratulations, you've just finished starting in Adopt Me!</h3></center>
