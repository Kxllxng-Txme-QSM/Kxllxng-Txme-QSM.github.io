    <center><h2>Bucks are the currency system for Adopt Me. You can get them by doing tasks your pet sets out for you. As your pet ages up tasks will become fewer and farther in between. But, if you promise you're new and you have a cat or dog someone will probably give you a cracked egg, another common, or maybe even an uncommon if you're lucky! Bucks allow you to get better homes, buy more pets, and buy fun potions to try on you and your pets!</h3></center>
